# hide-gitignored

Hide files from the file Explorer that are ignored by your workspace's 
`.gitignore` files, right-click any `.gitignore` to globally toggle visibility of ignored files.

Upon running the registered command, the workspace's `.gitignore` files are
read and converted to `files.exclude` rules that vscode can interpret.
Your workspace settings will be created or updated.
